# X-ray-Bremsstrahlung
A readout of characteristics for a X-ray Bremstrahlung measurement with a Molybdenum anode from a course I took at University of Copenhagen called "Experimental X-ray physics".

The code takes the data from a crystal diffraction measurement (here for LiF). The data is first corrected for a possible zero-point deviation, and then plottet. The script finds the K-edge transitions and print characteristic parameters for the measurement
